*obsidian*                 a plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian vault

A community fork of the Neovim plugin for writing and navigating Obsidian {2}
vaults, written in Lua, created by epwalsh {1}.

Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian -- a simple, markdown-based
notes app -- but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything
else.

This plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement it. The Obsidian
app comes with a mobile app and has a lot of functionality that's not feasible
to implement in Neovim, such as the graph explorer view. That said, this plugin
stands on its own as well. You don't necessarily need to use it alongside the
Obsidian app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🍴 About the fork

The original project has not been actively maintained for quite a while and with
the ever-changing Neovim ecosystem, new widely used tools such as blink.cmp {4}
or snacks.picker {3} were not supported.

With bugs, issues and pull requests piling up, people from the community decided
to fork and maintain the project.

- Discussions are happening in GitHub Discussions {5}
- Sponsor the project at Open Collective {6}
- See Breaking changes {7} to migrate from original repo or older releases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐ Features

▶️ Completion: Ultra-fast, asynchronous autocompletion for note references and
tags via nvim-cmp {9} or blink.cmp {8} (triggered by typing `[[` for wiki links,
`[` for markdown links, or `#` for tags)

🏃 Navigation: Navigate throughout your vault via links, backlinks, tags and
etc.

📷 Images: Paste images into notes.

📈 Status: See note status in footer like obsidian app.

Keymaps ~

- `smart_action`, bind to `<CR>` will:
  - If cursor is on a link, follow the link.
  - If cursor is on a tag, show all notes with that tag in a picker.
  - If cursor is on a checkbox, toggle the checkbox.
  - If cursor is on a heading, cycle the fold of that heading, see Folding {10}
    to set this up.
- `nav_link`, bind to `[o` and `]o` will navigate cursor to next valid link in
  the buffer.

For other available actions and remapping default ones, see Keymaps {11}

Commands ~

There's one entry point user command for this plugin: `Obsidian`

- `Obsidian<CR>` (`<enter>`) to select sub commands.
- `Obsidian <Tab>` to get completion for sub commands.
- Sub commands are context sensitive, meaning some actions will only appear
  when:
  - you are in a note.
  - you are in visual mode.
- See Commands {12} for more info.

Top level commands ~

- `:Obsidian dailies [OFFSET ...]` - open a picker list of daily notes
  - `:Obsidian dailies -2 1` to list daily notes from 2 days ago until tomorrow
- `:Obsidian new [TITLE]` - create a new note
- `:Obsidian open [QUERY]` - open a note in the Obsidian app
  - query is used to resolve the note to open by ID, path, or alias, else use current note
- `:Obsidian today [OFFSET]` - open/create a new daily note
  - offset is in days, e.g. use `:Obsidian today -1` to go to yesterday's note.
  - Unlike `:Obsidian yesterday` and `:Obsidian tomorrow` this command does not differentiate between weekdays and weekends
- `:Obsidian tomorrow` - open/create the daily note for the next working day
- `:Obsidian yesterday` - open/create the daily note for the previous working day
- `:Obsidian new_from_template [TITLE] [TEMPLATE]` - create a new note with `TITLE` from a template with the name `TEMPLATE`
  - both arguments are optional. If not given, the template will be selected from a list using your preferred picker
- `:Obsidian quick_switch` - switch to another note in your vault, searching by its name with a picker
- `:Obsidian search [QUERY]` - search for (or create) notes in your vault using `ripgrep` with your preferred picker
- `:Obsidian tags [TAG ...]` - get a picker list of all occurrences of the given tags
- `:Obsidian workspace [NAME]` - switch to another workspace

Note commands ~

- `:Obsidian backlinks` - get a picker list of references to the current note
  - `grr`/`vim.lsp.buf.references` to see references in quickfix list
- `:Obsidian follow_link [STRATEGY]` - follow a note reference under the cursor
  - available strategies: `vsplit, hsplit, vsplit_force, hsplit_force`
- `:Obsidian toc` - get a picker list of table of contents for current note
- `:Obsidian template [NAME]` - insert a template from the templates folder, selecting from a list using your preferred picker
  - Template {13}
- `:Obsidian links` - get a picker list of all links in current note
- `:Obsidian paste_img [IMGNAME]` - paste an image from the clipboard into the note at the cursor position by saving it to the vault and adding a markdown image link
  - Images {14}
- `:Obsidian rename [NEWNAME]` - rename the note of the current buffer or reference under the cursor, updating all backlinks across the vault
  - runs `:wa` before renaming, and loads every note with backlinks into your buffer-list
  - after renaming you need to do `:wa` again for changes to take effect
  - alternatively, call `vim.lsp.buf.rename` or use `grn`
- `:Obsidian toggle_checkbox` - cycle through checkbox options

Visual mode commands ~

- `:Obsidian extract_note [TITLE]` - extract the visually selected text into a new note and link to it
- `:Obsidian link [QUERY]` - link an inline visual selection of text to a note
  - query will be used to resolve the note by ID, path, or alias, else query is selected text
- `:Obsidian link_new [TITLE]` - create a new note and link it to an inline visual selection of text
  - if title is not given, selected text is used

📥 Installation

▋  Warning
▋ If you install from the latest release (recommended for stability) instead of
▋ `main`, be aware that the README on `main` may reference features that haven't
▋ been released yet. For that reason I recommend viewing the README on the tag for
▋ the latest release {33} instead of `main`.

▋  Tip
▋ To see your installation status, run `:checkhealth obsidian`
▋
▋ To try out or debug this plugin, use `minimal.lua` in the repo to run a clean
▋ instance of obsidian.nvim

Using `lazy.nvim` {34} ~

Click for install snippet ~

>lua
	return {
	  "obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim",
	  version = "*", -- recommended, use latest release instead of latest commit
	  ft = "markdown",
	  -- Replace the above line with this if you only want to load obsidian.nvim for markdown files in your vault:
	  -- event = {
	  --   -- If you want to use the home shortcut '~' here you need to call 'vim.fn.expand'.
	  --   -- E.g. "BufReadPre " .. vim.fn.expand "~" .. "/my-vault/*.md"
	  --   -- refer to `:h file-pattern` for more examples
	  --   "BufReadPre path/to/my-vault/*.md",
	  --   "BufNewFile path/to/my-vault/*.md",
	  -- },
