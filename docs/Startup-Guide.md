## What is obsidian.nvim

Think of it in two ways:

- If you are an obsidian user:
  - This is implementation of obsidian's capabilities with neovim's API, everything you know (except GUI features like graph view and canvas), like links, backlinks, tags, header links, block links and etc.
- If you are a neovim user:
  - This is a markdown LSP, a vault is a project (a folder of markdown files), you get completions, find references, hover, and etc.

## Minimal Initial Steps
