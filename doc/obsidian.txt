*obsidian*           a plugin for writing and navigating an Obsidian vault

obsidian.nvim
A **community fork** of the Neovim plugin for writing and navigating Obsidian
<https://obsidian.md> vaults, written in Lua, created by epwalsh
<https://github.com/epwalsh>.

Built for people who love the concept of Obsidian – a simple, markdown-based
notes app – but love Neovim too much to stand typing characters into anything
else.

_This plugin is not meant to replace Obsidian, but to complement it._ The
Obsidian app comes with a mobile app and has a lot of functionality that’s
not feasible to implement in Neovim, such as the graph explorer view. That
said, this plugin stands on its own as well. You don’t necessarily need to
use it alongside the Obsidian app.


==============================================================================
1. 🍴 About the fork                          *obsidian-🍴-about-the-fork*

The original project has not been actively maintained for quite a while and
with the ever-changing Neovim ecosystem, new widely used tools such as
blink.cmp <https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp> or snacks.picker
<https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/picker.md> were not
supported.

With bugs, issues and pull requests piling up, people from the community
decided to fork and maintain the project.

Discussions are happening in GitHub discussions
<https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim/discussions/6>.


==============================================================================
2. ⭐ Features                                        *obsidian-⭐-features*

▶️ **Completion:** Ultra-fast, asynchronous autocompletion for note
references and tags via nvim-cmp <https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp> or
blink.cmp <https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp> (triggered by typing `[[` for
wiki links, `[` for markdown links, or `#` for tags)

🏃 **Navigation:** Navigate throughout your vault via links, backlinks, tags
and etc.

📷 **Images:** Paste images into notes.

📈 **Status:** See note status in footer like obsidian app.


KEYMAPS                                                     *obsidian-keymaps*

- `smart_action`, bind to `<CR>` will:
    - If cursor is on a link, follow the link.
    - If cursor is on a tag, show all notes with that tag in a picker.
    - If cursor is on a checkbox, toggle the checkbox.
    - If cursor is on a heading, cycle the fold of that heading, see Folding <https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim/wiki/Folding> to set this up.
- `nav_link`, bind to `[o` and `]o` will navigate cursor to next valid link in the buffer.

For other available actions and remapping default ones, see Keymaps
<https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim/wiki/Keymaps>


COMMANDS                                                   *obsidian-commands*

There’s one entry point user command for this plugin: `Obsidian`

- `Obsidian<CR>` (`<enter>`) to select sub commands.
- `Obsidian <Tab>` to get completion for sub commands.
- Sub commands are context sensitive, meaning some actions will only appear when:
    - you are in a note.
    - you are in visual mode.
- See Commands <https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim/wiki/Commands> for more info.

4. 📥 Installation                              *obsidian-📥-installation*

To configure obsidian.nvim you just need to call `require("obsidian").setup({
... })` with the desired options. Here are some examples using different plugin
managers. The full set of |obsidian-plugin-dependencies| and configuration
options
<https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-configuration>
are listed below.


  [!WARNING] If you install from the latest release (recommended for stability)
  instead of `main`, be aware that the README on `main` may reference features
  that haven’t been released yet. For that reason I recommend viewing the
  README on the tag for the latest release
  <https://github.com/obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim/releases> instead of `main`.

  [!TIP] To see your installation status, run `:checkhealth obsidian`
  To try out or debug this plugin, use `minimal.lua` in the repo to run a clean
  instance of obsidian.nvim
